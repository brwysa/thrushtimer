#### Description:

THRUSHTIMER is a web application built with flask used for The Pomodoro Technique. For many people, time is an enemy. We race against the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches us to work with time instead of struggling against it. A revolutionary time management system, it is at once deceptively simple to learn and life-changing to use. There are six steps for the technique, and thrushtimer is here to help users fulfill those steps.

##### 1. CHOOSE A TASK YOU’D LIKE TO GET DONE

Something big, something small, something you’ve been putting off for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s something that deserves your full, undivided attention.

##### 2. SET THE POMODORO FOR 25 MINUTES

Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.

##### 3. WORK ON THE TASK UNTIL THE POMODORO® RINGS

Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes. If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.

##### 4. WHEN THE POMODORO RINGS, PUT A CHECKMARK ON A PAPER

Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro® on a task.

##### 5. TAKE A SHORT BREAK

Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

##### 6. EVERY 4 POMODOROS TAKE A LONGER BREAK

Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a more extended break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.

The duration for each work session, short break, and long break are entirely up to each individual, although the default time set was a 25-minute work session, 5-minute short break, and 15-minute long break. There are 4 pages in this web application, home, task, about, and setting.

### Home

There is a timer for each timer (work, short break, and long break). The user can play, pause, and reset the timer. Once played, the timer will start, and a song will also be played to further stimulate the brain. After a work session is finished, the user will be automatically redirected to the short break timer. After the short break timer is completed, the user will be redirected to the work timer. This goes on 3 times because the user will be redirected to the long break timer after the 4th work session.

### Task

You can add a task using the form at the top of the page on the task page. The form consists of 3 fields, the task title, the number of estimated work sessions needed to complete said task, and the task description. After the user submits the form, they can scroll down to the bottom of the page, which will have all of their tasks in cards. In each card, there is a task title and task description. The user can complete or delete their task in the card as well. As the number of sessions needed is estimated, there is a “Session(s) left” field; here, the user can manually increase or decrease the number of sessions left required.

### About

Here, there is an explanation of the Pomodoro Technique and each page’s functions.

### Setting

As mentioned before, the duration of the timers is entirely up to the individual. On the setting page, the user can customize their timer durations.

Before anyone can use this web application, they need to register and log in first on their respective page. Both the login and register pages have been made and have error preventions.
